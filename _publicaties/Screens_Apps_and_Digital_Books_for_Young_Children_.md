## Introduction
Thirty years into the digital era, it is now quite clear that
apps, digital books, and video streaming services are game
changers in the young child’s learning environment.

Traditionally built games, books, and educational television
programs are rapidly giving way to digital content on electronic devices, often handheld and mobile in the near environment. We are only beginning to understand what this
digital shift might mean for young children’s language and
early literacy development and what potentials these new
technologies might bring to the learning environments of
young children. In this special topic, we survey this emerging field of research in early childhood to gauge what digital
resources seem to afford young children in their environments and to what effect.

We invited authors to submit articles that explore to what
extent digital resources can enrich young children’s learning
environment. The special topic contains an eclectic set of
articles that investigate a range of multimedia sources
(games, books, programs) and learning settings (home,
school). Collectively, the articles focus on a relatively large
sample of young children in the 4- to 6-year age range (~1,500), thus providing a rich set of observational data for
examining child-screen interactions. Our reading of the set
of articles leads us to a twofold set of descriptive observations relevant to the young child’s learning environment: (a)
changes in the learning environment and the consequences
these have for participatory interaction and (b) changes in
design of learning materials as a result of digitization—that
is, the affordances of the digital material. From each set, we
learn more about the digital resource in the learning environment—that is, what it brings to the child’s language and
early literacy experience. And we also gain insight into what
is still unknown about enhanced apps, books, and programs
and their potentials for improving and enriching the language learning environment of the young child. Below we
briefly highlight key findings related to changes in the learning environment and digital design, recognizing that these
represent but a “slice” of the rapidly growing research in this
field. Based on the findings, we then summarize what we
consider as “alerts” to our colleagues in the field. By this, we
mean a greater attentiveness to the design quality of digital
resources and their usage in the immediate learning environment to children’s benefit.
