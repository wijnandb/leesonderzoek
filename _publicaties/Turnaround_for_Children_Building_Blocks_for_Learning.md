This paper began with a conversation about children. At Turnaround for Children, we wanted to understand how they
acquire the skills and mindsets for learning. Which skills do we need to build in children for them to be successful in
school? And if we know what they are, can they be taught? How does growing up with adversity impact the acquisition of
these critical skills?

Brooke Stafford-Brizard set out to answer these questions. What emerged after a deep dive into scientific research from
diverse fields is Building Blocks for Learning. It’s a framework for comprehensive student development, grounded in
science, in service of equity. It suggests a developmental continuum that starts in early childhood but doesn’t stop there. It
acknowledges that children don’t always get the same start in life and they don’t all follow the same smooth path through
it. The paper contains the background and rationale to support and develop Building Blocks for Learning among all children,
especially in grades K-12.1

We present this framework in the hope that it will serve as a platform for multiple stakeholders from the areas of policy,
research and practice to build a more comprehensive approach to student development in schools, and perhaps even
beyond schools. This work contributes to a number of other efforts currently underway to create a more coherent field of
policy, research, practice and measurement focusing on the full set of skills and mindsets that students need to succeed in
school and to thrive in the years beyond. Turnaround for Children offers this framework as a contribution to a vital
collaborative endeavor to deepen and transform K-12 education. Instead of asking children to beat the odds, we can use
this knowledge to change the odds for many children.
